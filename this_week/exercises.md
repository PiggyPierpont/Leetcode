# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

> Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that > each element appear only once and return the new length.

> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

> For example,
> Given input array A = [1,1,2],

> Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].

# Plus One

> Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, plus one to the number.

> The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

# Pascal's Triangle

> Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

> For example, given numRows = 5,
> Return
